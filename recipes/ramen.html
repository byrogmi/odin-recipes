  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Yes, ramen that’s (undetectably) vegan and totally doable. Get your soup bowls, friends. It’s happening!</p>

  <p>Amazing, 10-ingredient vegan ramen made with 1-pot mushroom broth, crispy tofu, and miso-roasted vegetables. A hearty, satisfying, and delicious plant-based meal.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Tbsp grape seed or avocado oil</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, roughly chopped (5 cloves yield ~2 1/2 Tbsp or 18 g)</li>
    <li>1 3-inch piece ginger (peeled and diced)</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion (coarsely chopped)</li>
    <li>6 cups vegetable stock</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce (plus more to taste)</li>
    <li>0.5 ounces dehydrated shiitake mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp white or yellow miso paste (ensure vegan friendliness on package)</li>
    <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil (for flavor // plus more to taste)</li>
    <li>8 ounces ramen noodles* (ensure gluten-free and vegan-friendliness on package)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Toppings (Optional)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped green onion</li>
    <li>10 ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
    <li>Miso-glazed carrots</li>
    <li>Miso-glazed baby bok choy</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger, and onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally for 5-8 minutes or until the onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the vegetable broth to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Use a whisk (or wooden spoon) to scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom to enhance the flavor of the broth.</li>
    <li>Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated mushrooms – stir.</li>
    <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.</li>
    <li>Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the miso paste at this time.</li>
    <li>When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots, baby bok choy, and quick-seared tofu).</li>
    <li>NOODLES: Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size of pan you may need to do this in two batches // use fewer or more batches if altering batch size) and cook according to package instructions – about 4-5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I discarded them).</li>
    <li>To serve, divide ramen noodles between four (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, green onion, or seared tofu.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>

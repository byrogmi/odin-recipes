    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>4 cups (946 mL) vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1 (15-ounce / 440g) can pinto, kidney, or black beans drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce / 790g) can crushed tomatoes, fire roasted</li>

    <li>1 (15-ounce / 430g) can sweet corn, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>12 ounces (340g) elbow pasta or cavatappi pasta (gluten-free as needed)</li>
    <li>2-3 teaspoons agave nectar, maple syrup, coconut sugar, or brown sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Toppings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    <li>Several squeezes of lime juice</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded vegan cheese (optional but recommended)</li>
    <li>Vegan sour cream, for serving (optional but recommended)</li>
    <li>Pickled red onions***** (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a Dutch oven (or a large nonstick soup pot), heat the 1 tablespoon oil (or 1/3 cup water) over medium heat. Once the oil is hot (or once the water is simmering), add the onions and cook for 2 minutes, seasoning with a pinch of salt. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and crumbled tempeh, and cook for 5 more minutes. Add the chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir the spices into the vegetables and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Pour in the vegetable broth to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Add in the beans, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, and pasta. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through but not soggy. If you want it to be a bit saucier, add a splash more of broth or water.</li>
    <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the agave or other sweetener. Taste for seasonings again and adjust accordingly.</li>
    <li>If using vegan cheese, sprinkle it all over the top of the chili mac. Cover the lid and let warm through for a few minutes. Allow chili mac to rest at least 15 minutes before serving and top with fresh chopped cilantro and any other desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>

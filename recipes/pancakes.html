Like traditional pancake recipes, you'll mix the dry and wet ingredients to create a smooth batter that promises airy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

This is a pancake stack you won't be able to resist!</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a Dutch oven (or a large nonstick soup pot), heat the 1 tablespoon oil (or 1/3 cup water) over medium heat. Once the oil is hot (or once the water is simmering), add the onions and cook for 2 minutes, seasoning with a pinch of salt. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and crumbled tempeh, and cook for 5 more minutes. Add the chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir the spices into the vegetables and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Pour in the vegetable broth to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Add in the beans, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, and pasta. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through but not soggy. If you want it to be a bit saucier, add a splash more of broth or water.</li>
    <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the agave or other sweetener. Taste for seasonings again and adjust accordingly.</li>
    <li>If using vegan cheese, sprinkle it all over the top of the chili mac. Cover the lid and let warm through for a few minutes. Allow chili mac to rest at least 15 minutes before serving and top with fresh chopped cilantro and any other desired toppings.</li>
